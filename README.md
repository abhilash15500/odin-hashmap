# odin-hashmap

## Learnings  
- Implemented a hashmap using an array with linked list chaining for collision handling.  
- Learned efficient hashing, dynamic resizing, load factor management, and linked list traversal.  

## Features  
- Supports key-value storage with collision resolution using chaining.  
- Dynamic resizing based on load factor.  
- Provides methods: `set`, `get`, `has`, `remove`, `keys`, `values`, `entries`, and `clear`.
